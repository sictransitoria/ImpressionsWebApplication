<h1> Impressions | A Photo Sharing Web Application </h1>

Most hiring managers we have interviewed told us they expect their Junior Web Developers to work well in teams and show the ability to complete a project from start to finish. 
This project is a great way to show potential employers that you can do both.

Impressions is an application that resembles Instagram. Impressions has a basic file upload feature and user authentication.

<h1>Web Dev Tools</h1>

We used the following web development tools to develop the app.

<ul>

<li>Node.js

<li>Sequelize

</ul>
